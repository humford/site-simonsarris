For the sake of Simplicity I'll start with Gatsby. The layout works. Markdown pages work. Yay progress.

Gotta add some pages, but its workable enough to commit.

Had a nice cup (ok 3) of Jardin Bleu this afternoon.

oh well, time to use it as a templating engine so I can keep me background state across "pages"

Today I abandon my old pure CSS and HTML site to build one with new and lasting capabilities. things like pages other than index dot h t m l. Lame, I know. Even lamer, I want to keep (css or maybe soon canvas) animations persistent across pages, so I'm going to have to use JaVAscRiPt to get the thing working. Kinda sad about this. But it's either have a page that works without scripty dips, restart animations on every page click, or maintain my panache across pages via something like react. or preact. This has an added bonus: Not knowing p/react is perhaps unwise professionally, and if I want to call myself a "front end" "developer" I should probably know "frameworks".

Had some great tea this afternoon. 4 fruits rouges, dammann freres.
