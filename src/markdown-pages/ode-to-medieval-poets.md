By W.H. Auden

<div>Chaucer, Langland, Douglas, Dunbar, with all your</div>
<div>brother Anons, how on earth did you ever manage,</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without anaesthetics or plumbing,</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in daily peril from witches, warlocks,</div>

<div>lepers, The Holy Office, foreign mercenaries</div>
<div>burning as they came, to write so cheerfully,</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with no grimaces of self-pathos?</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long-winded you could be but not vulgar,</div>

<div>bawdy but not grubby, your raucous flytings</div>
<div>sheer high-spirited fun, whereas our makers,</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beset by every creature comfort,</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;immune, they believe, to all superstitions,</div>

<div>even at their best are so often morose or</div>
<div>kinky, petrified by their gorgon egos.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all ask, but I doubt if anyone</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can really say why all age-groups should find our</div>
<div>
<div>Age quite so repulsive. Without its heartless</div>
<div>engines, though, you could not tenant my book-shelves,</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on hand to delect my ear and chuckle</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my sad flesh: I would gladly just now be</div>

<div>turning out verses to applaud a thundery</div>
<div>jovial June when the judas-tree is in blossom,</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but am forbidden by the knowledge</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that you would have wrought them so much better.</div>
