### We should all be supplementing with vitamin D

Below is a loose (but I think non-trivial) case for mass vitamin D supplementation ASAP. This is something you can do yourself or with your family, today.

Reviewing the data we have so far, a line of questions seems striking: Has the virus hit locales the hardest which have lower than average sunshine? Geriatric patients who *survive*, do they leave the house more, etc? I now suspect that total sunshine hours correlate somewhat to the *lethality* of outcomes in different areas.

Note that I have no claims to make about *transmission,* or advice beyond vitamin D supplementation. My level of certainty is low. I do think this information is optimistic, because the timing for many countries—facing this pandemic in March and April instead of January and February—might make this easier to bear.

North(?) Italy has a large crisis so far, and some people making graphs are saying we (the US or European countries) are so-many days behind Italy. What is odd to me are the countries doing much better which had their outbreaks several days before Italy, like Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.

Data as of March 16:

Malaysia
* Confirmed: 428
* Deaths: 0
* Recovered: 42
* Active: 386

Vietnam
* Confirmed: 56
* Deaths: 0
* Recovered: 16
* Active: 40

Thailand
* Confirmed: 114
* Deaths: 1
* Recovered: 35
* Active: 78

The question here is, why does Malaysia not have a single death yet, with several recoveries, when their outbreak started before Italy? Many of the affected are 40-60 years of age, and doubtless there are far more cases than the confirmed, probably thousands more, yet I have found nothing about overflowing hospitals for these countries.

So if the Italy pandemic model is expected to scale to every country, and these countries above probably are not the most organized countries like you could say of SK or Singapore, and have had cases since January, why 1 death between them? Maybe they missed some, maybe many, but it would be hard to miss a death count by *overflowing-hospital* amounts. I'm trying to find a model that fits, given that the data is obviously incomplete in a lot of ways. Malaysia is interesting since the start of their outbreak was 6 days before Italy, with (presumably) thousands of undetected cases.

## Sunshine

Sunshine *seems* to matter. Have a look at Sunshine hours, in March unless otherwise noted

Places hard hit:
* Wuhan: **100** (In Feb)
* Paris: **79-129** (Feb-March, North France harder it by # of cases, cannot find death info)
* Bergamo Italy: **100-150** (Feb-March average)
* Seattle WA: **100-150** (Feb-March)

Iran has very diverse sunshine amounts so we need to know where the deaths are concentrated.

* In Rasht, Iran **90, 78, 71, 113** for Jan, Feb, Mar, April
* Tehran is better: **169, 180, 203, 221** for Jan, Feb, Mar, April

And of course, any pollution will further reduce sun, and worsen respiratory diseases.

Places less hard hit:

* Bangkok **250-275** (Feb-March)
* Kuala Lumpur **185, 192, 208** (Jan Feb March)
* Ho Chi Minh City, **272** (March)
* Seoul: **175-200** (Feb-March) South Korea contained it of course, but their lethality numbers are also lower, and its the lethality that I find odd in all this.

What would be useful in determining lethality of place is very accurate death location information. Being approximate and comparing areas by average sunshine hours per month, and comparing areas that are hit hard vs places that are not, a sunshine, or maybe vitamin D hypothesis, becomes compelling to me as a way to reduce mortality. This is a somewhat faint correlation, but since vitamin D is very cheap and widely available, skipping out seems unwise. Some sunlight data is below.

Are there other places worth looking, or other countries with early outbreaks that have odd results?

The worst US places by sunshine are Alaska, but also Ohio and Washington. Even then, places like Juneau AK rapidly get more sunshine. March is 137.3 hours for them, April is 182.3 hours.

## How Much Vitamin D?

There are lots of papers on Vitamin D and influenza which suggest it's worth trying at some level. 5,000 IU daily for non-infected people should be easy for everyone to do. One paper, titled [Vitamin D for Influenza](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4463890/) says:

> The Institute of Medicine recommendation for adults younger than 70 years of age is 600 IU of vitamin D daily. We are told that this would achieve a level of 50 nmol/L in greater than 97.5% of individuals. Regrettably, a statistical error has resulted in erroneous recommendations by the Institute of Medicine leading to this conclusion and it might actually take 8800 IU of vitamin D to achieve this level in 97.5% of the population. This is a serious public health blunder.

> A colleague of mine and I have introduced vitamin D at doses that have achieved greater than 100 nmol/L in most of our patients for the past number of years, and we now see very few patients in our clinics with the flu or influenza-like illness. In those patients who do have influenza, we have treated them with the vitamin D hammer, as coined by my colleague. This is a 1-time 50 000 IU dose of vitamin D3 or 10 000 IU 3 times daily for 2 to 3 days. The results are dramatic, with complete resolution of symptoms in 48 to 72 hours. One-time doses of vitamin D at this level have been used safely and have never been shown to be toxic.8 We urgently need a study of this intervention. The cost of vitamin D is about a penny for 1000 IU, so this treatment costs less than a dollar.

I cannot personally suggest anything beyond "normal" daily amounts, and you should read more before trying anything larger than those amounts. 5,000 IU/day pills are sold everywhere and are obviously a safe start.

## Conclusion

Vitamin D supplementation for *everyone* might be a good idea. It's inexpensive and has no side-effects. Spring might be optimistic for the northern hemisphere, and somewhat worrisome for the southern.

Getting sun might be an even better idea. Vitamin D is a proxy for sunlight, and sunlight almost certainly has other good effects, like the synthesis of nitric oxide.
