Reviewing the data we have so far, a line of questions seems striking: Has the virus hit locales the hardest which have lower than average sunshine? Geriatric patients who *survive*, do they leave the house more, etc? I now suspect that total sunshine hours correlate somewhat to the *lethality* of outcomes in different areas.

Note that I have no claims to make about *transmission,* or advice beyond vitamin D supplementation. My level of certainty is low. I do think this information is optimistic, because the timing for many countries—facing this pandemic in March and April instead of January and Februrary—may make this easier to bear.

North(?) Italy has a large crisis so far, and some people making graphs are saying we (the US or European countries) are so-many days behind Italy. What is odd to me are the countries doing much better which had their outbreaks several days before Italy, like Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.

Data as of March 16:

Malaysia
* Confirmed: 428
* Deaths: 0
* Recovered: 42
* Active: 386

Vietnam
* Confirmed: 56
* Deaths: 0
* Recovered: 16
* Active: 40

Thailand
* Confirmed: 114
* Deaths: 1
* Recovered: 35
* Active: 78

The question here is, why does Malaysia not have a single death yet, with several recoveries, when their outbreak started before Italy? Many of the affected are 40-60 years of age, and doubtless there are far more cases than the confirmed, probably thousands more, yet I have found nothing about overflowing hospitals for these countries.

So if the Italy pandemic model is expected to scale to every country, and these countrie above probably are not the most organized countries like you could say of SK or Singapore, and have had cases since January, why 1 death between them? Maybe they missed some, maybe many, but it would be hard to miss a death count by *overflowing-hospital* amounts. I'm trying to find a model that fits, given that the data is obviously incomplete in a lot of ways. Malaysia is interesting since the start of their outbreak was 6 days before Italy, with (presumably) thousands of undetected cases.

## Sunshine

Sunshine *seems* to matter. Have a look at Sunshine hours, in March unless otherwise noted

Places hard hit:
* Wuhan: **100** (In feb)
* Paris: **129** (North France harder it by # of cases, cannot find death info)
* Bergamo Italy: **100-150** (Feb-March average)
* Seattle WA: **100-150** (Feb-March)

Places less hard hit:
* Bangkok **250-275** (Feb-March)
* Kuala Lumpur **185, 192, 208** (Jan Feb March)
* Ho Chi Minh City, **272** (March)
* Seoul: **175-200** (Feb-March) South Korea contained it of course, but their lethality numbers are also lower, and its the lethality that I find odd in all this.

What would be useful in determining lethality of place is very accurate death location information. Being approximate and comparing areas by average sunshine hours per month, and comparing areas that are hit hard vs places that are not, a sunshine, or maybe vitamin D hypothesis, becomes compelling to me as a way to reduce mortality. This is a somewhat faint correlation, but since vitamin D is very cheap and widely available, skipping out seems unwise. Some sunlight data is below.

Are there other places worth looking, or other countries with early outbreaks that have odd results?

The worst US places by sunshine are Alaska, but also Ohio and Washington. Even then, places like Juneau AK rapidly get more sunshine. March is 137.3 hours for them, April is 182.3 hours.

## Conclusion

Vitamin D supplementation for *everyone* might be a good idea. It's inexpensive and has no side-effects. Spring might be optimistic for the northern hemisphere, and somewhat worrisome for the southern.
