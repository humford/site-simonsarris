*What's new:*

ðŸ“¯ In June I have started a [newsletter](https://simonsarris.substack.com/). It shall be a stromata of anecdotes, fables, tales, advice if you ask for it, photography, questions, sentiment, and ways to get lost in the forest. Some of it will be private. Some will be legible. Not too legible I hope.

[Are We Still Thinking?](https://medium.com/@simon.sarris/are-we-still-thinking-795bd9f4a658) (Dec 17 2019, on Medium)

We lived in a state of dialogue for millennia, almost all knowledge was two-way communication.
Even with books, every person talked to more people, sometimes in a single day, than they had ever read.
Then between the printing press and radio we switched to one-way communication as the norm,
and now it's the opposite. The consequences of this are not fully appreciated.
