[Are We Still Thinking?](https://medium.com/@simon.sarris/are-we-still-thinking-795bd9f4a658) (Dec 17 2019, on Medium)

We lived in a state of dialogue for millennia, almost all knowledge was two-way communication.
Even with books, every person talked to more people, sometimes in a single day, than they had ever read.
Then between the printing press and radio we switched to one-way communication as the norm,
and now it's the opposite. The consequences of this are not fully appreciated.
