For micro-blogging I use <a href="https://twitter.com/simonsarris" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my Twitter</a> a lot lately.</p>

For longer writing I have been using <a href="https://medium.com/@simon.sarris" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Medium</a>, and this site.</p>

Recently written stuff is on the [homepage](/) right now, or else hiding.
