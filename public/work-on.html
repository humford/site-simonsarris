            <p>I post lots of documentary-style photos to twitter, such as
              <a href="https://twitter.com/simonsarris/status/1164147316745523200" target="_blank">Pictures of Home</a> and photo-blogging
              <a href="https://twitter.com/simonsarris/status/1183143604925190144" target="_blank">my Home, the first year</a>.
            <p>I advocate at-least-one-photo-a-day, partly because it teaches us to notice our surroundings more, partly for the huge
            boost to memory, partly because looking back on the record of normal day to day
            life is its own kind of beautiful. Your own aesthetic tastes are a kind of self discovery,
            and one of the best ways to exercise this self discovery is through photography.
            It compels you to ponder what is meaningful and beautiful in your surroundings.
            Once you know this, you can make them more beautiful.
            I share photos because I want to make people feel wonder and emotions that are difficult
            to put into words but feel very right to "show." If you see and capture them you can
            show that they exist as part of the landscape, that emotions surround us, they are not just internal.
            <p>Photos, like paintings, help you see the moods that inhabit the world.

                  We lived in a state of dialogue for millennia, almost all knowledge was two-way communication.
                  Even with books, everyS person talked to more people, sometimes in a single day, than they had ever read.
                  Then between the printing press and radio we switched to one-way communication as the norm,
                  and now it's the opposite. The consequences of this are not fully appreciated.

<h2>Work on these (other) things</h2>
<p>
  Tyler Cowen's <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/12/work-on-these-things.html">
  Work on these things</a> post has great suggestions, though they mostly
  cut into the typical economist grooves. To extend his idea, here are some projects I think are important, that I'd
  like to see attempted or funded, or will attempt myself.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Develop the aesthetics of progress.</strong>
  Humans have innate, Apollonian love of an ordered world and the mastery of immense forces,
  including mastery of nature, from beautiful gardens to spaceflight.
  These feelings speak to us, capturing them propels us. The beauty in these things matters.
</p>
<img src="images\airplane.jpg" style="max-width: 340px; vertical-align: middle;" />
<img src="images\dam.jpg" style="max-width: 340px; vertical-align: middle;" />
<p>
Rationalistic worldviews have downplayed much of what motivates humans, which seems like a uniquely modern mistake.
This impacts every aspect of lives,
including scientific progress, architecture, even birth rates.
The future starts from belief, not rationalism, and belief is cultivated partly with aesthetics.
Progress will come from regaining a grasp on the aesthetics that move us.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Develop the folk future.</strong> Consider the difference between these two images:
</p>
<img src="images\future1.jpg" style="max-width: 300px; vertical-align: middle;" />
<img src="images\future2.jpg" style="max-width: 380px; vertical-align: middle;" />
<p>
  How do they make you feel?
</p>
<p>
  Visions of the future need to allow people—not just the cleverest among us, but all people—to
  imagine accepting their place in a natural order.
  For any future place, there has to be a feeling that you could come of age there,
  not just explore it once you are already an adult.
</p>
<p>
  Many fairy tales and stories generally are about finding one's place.
  You start as a child, full of wonder, and you end with the mastery of the world.
  So it is with creating the future:
  If you want people to <em>believe</em> in progress,
  the fairy tale is what you must show them, not the cyber highway or the economic version of vital statistics.
  If the future is to be concieved, I hope it is one that is far happier, messier, and greener than
  futuristic cinema currently enjoys depicting.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Make the world better for average people.</strong> The lowest hanging fruit in the progress
  of many endeavors is forgotten because the average person is often forgotten. It's worth starting
  to explore the area by simply asking ourselves, what products, apps, etc, have improved the lives of
  the average person (barely online, barely tech literate) the most in the past 10 years? How? How are they
  different from the ones that have improved our (presumably tech-literate) lives?
</p>
<p>
  For example, in many (semi-)rural communities near me, I think Square card readers have changed the game
  for viability of farmers markets, makers markets, and other pop-up businesses.
  I know they have for my low-tech friends. In this way Square perhaps has done more than the FANGs combined
  to change the livelihoods of semi-rural places in the last decade.
  <em>What other services are not-affluent-20-to-30-somethings missing?</em>
  What is still too hard for the average person to do? How can we improve it?
</p>

<p><strong>Recapture beauty.</strong></p>
<img src="images\house1.jpg" style="max-width: 300px; vertical-align: middle;" />
<img src="images\house2.jpg" style="max-width: 380px; vertical-align: middle;" />
<p>
How did this happen? Even rich people often live in terribly ugly homes.
With all the advantages of technology, we rarely build beautiful structures.
All the progress in mechanization and materials seems to be little match
for the colossal bad taste that permeates modern environments.
It is far easier to move the earth than it was 200 years ago,
yet the end result gives a feeling that nobody is really trying their best.
</p>
<p>
This extends beyond structures. The machine age has let us do so much, but it has also degraded work and craft
into a means, taking something away from us in the process.
What it has done to work it has done to art and leisure as well.
If we may have another renaissance, it will be a recapturing of beauty.
</p>

<p>
Where gods may exist in history, they walk in gardens, temples, groves.
I wonder every day: If we stop building beautiful places and magnificent things, why have we done so?
What forces have left the world? What work can we do towards recapturing these things?
